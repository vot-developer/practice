A bathroom is being designed for the use of both males and females in an office but requires the following constraints
to be maintained:

There cannot be men and women in the bathroom at the same time.
There should never be more than three employees in the bathroom simultaneously.
The solution should avoid deadlocks. For now, though, donâ€™t worry about starvation.
